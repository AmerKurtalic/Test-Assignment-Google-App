# Test-Assignment-Google-App

I created this solution using scripts in Google Sheets. 
In order to minimize user input I have added the Create as Document button on the toolbar, in order to automate the process faster.
Once the user clicks on the "Create as Document" button, the user will be prompted with the pop up windows to enter the file name, document header and also where to store the Created document.

In conclusion, this code converts the data from Google Sheets to Google Doc.
